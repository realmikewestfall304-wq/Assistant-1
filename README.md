## Example: Evaluating a Business Idea

The assistant will analyze your idea and provide honest feedback:

```
Describe your business idea: A guaranteed get-rich-quick scheme with no competition

⚠️ CONCERNS (Things that could sink this):
  1. Nothing is guaranteed in business. This mindset could lead to poor risk management.
  2. Get-rich-quick schemes rarely work. Focus on sustainable value creation.
  3. No competition might mean no market. Validate demand before proceeding.

🎯 CAUTION: This idea needs significant refinement before moving forward.
```
